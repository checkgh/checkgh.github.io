OSI MODEL
OSI is an abbreviation of open  system interconnection.This model defines a networking framework to implement protocols in 7 layers.This model is just to give a conceptual framework of how networking works so that we can understand it better.international standard organization developed the OSI model of which  it's divided into 7 layers.ie; layer 7 ; Application
                           Layer 6; presentation
                           Layer 5; session
                           Layer 4; transport
                            Layer 3; network
                           Layer 2; data link
                            Layer 1; physical
LAYER 7
Everything in this layer is application specified .  It is the layer that is the closest to the end user eg;web browser (safari, chrome, Firefox)etc                                               

LAYER 6
This layer provides independence from difference in data representation eg; encryption.it works to transform data into the form that the application layer can accept.eg TIFF,GIF,PICT ect. 
LAYER 5
The session sets up coordinate and terminates conversations ,exchanges and dialogues between the application at each end.eg; SQL,RPC etc.
LAYER 4
It provides transparent transfer of data between end system or host  and it's responsible for end to end error recovery and flow control .eg;SPX,TCP, FDDI.
LAYER 3
It helps in switching snd routing techologies work . It includes routing through different routers.Routers at this layer helps do them efficiently.
LAYER 2
Data packets are encoded and decoded into bits .eg;PPP,FDDI etc.
LAYER 1
It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data and carrier including defining cables, cards,and physical aspects eg;FDDI,B835,v.25 etc.
